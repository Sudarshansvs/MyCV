  <h3>Graduation Project</h3>
  <p>PROJECT AREA: <strong>ADVANCED AGRICULTURE POST HARVESTING MACHINARES
</strong><br>
PROJECT TITLE: <strong>MODELLING AND FABRICATION OF A DEHUMIDIFICATION REPOSITORY</strong><br />
<strong>Description:</strong> we see that most of the farmers after harvesting, dry their harvested crop by sun drying,
which has become a great huddle for them due to frequent change in the climatic conditions. My project is a
repository which modulates the moisture and temperature within the container and dries the grains within
24hrs and efficient than the regular sun drying.</p>

  <li>As a part of my internship program, I got introduced to various practical real-time maintenance
  processes employed in the Indian Railways along with numerous material and design attributes which aid
  in betterment of comfort, improved lifespan and reduction in overall costs of that locomotive which
  enabled me to extend my engineering knowledge to tackle problems in the practical scenario.--@SOUTH CENTRAL RAILWAYS, Hyderabad</li>

  <li><strong>KONKUR M-COVER </strong>is a critical component. Which makes up the projectile of the missile. In this
  specific case the KONKUR M-COVER for the KONKUR missile is manufactured. The work has been
  carried out in BDL. Because of the high precision requirements of the component, manufacturing is done
  in a CNC 2 axis Turning, 4 axis Drilling and 5 axis Milling machines. G-codes and M-codes are fed
  into the CNC manually based on the sequence of operation given as input to that software and the design
  is developed in both CATIA and FUSION 360.--@BHARATH DYNAMICS LIMITED, Hyderabad</li>
